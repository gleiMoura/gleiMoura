### 🏷️ About me
<p>
  I currently live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I love science and technology. I've started to work with education, teaching phisics at schools using robotics to improve the skills of my students. I've started with c++ language, but now I am working with other languages like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a litle of python.

  In my free time i like to read science fiction books 📚 and my favorite author is ISAAC ASIMOV. I like to listen to music 🎵 (I prefer Indie) and my favorite drinks are coffee and beer.
